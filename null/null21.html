This seems to be the path to freedom.<br><br>You come across a small bag of food and water next to a corpse and take it to Noel.<br><br>There was another path but you two could clearly see it was a dead end with even more corpses.<br><br>Thankfully it has nothing else.<br><br>Soon enough, you two could both see the entrance. Both of you happily run over. Even if you two couldn't survive out there, it was better than staying inside.<br><br>Besides, they have each other.<br><br>That's all that matters right now.</p>
