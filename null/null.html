                    You are your family's loyal companion, following them wherever they go and protecting them. One of them was lost to you just recently, but he gave you a mission.
                    
                    What that mission was, you can't quite remember.

                    Despite the pooling blood as a warning, Noel and you still took left.
                    
                    It was a disaster.
                    
                    You tried your best to protect Noel but was killed.
                    
                    Little Noel has no chance alive and was also killed by the hoard of zombies.

                    Noel and you decided to keep going straight. This seems to be the path to freedom.
                    
                    You come across a small bag of food and water next to a corpse and take it to Noel.
                    
                    There was another path but you two could clearly see it was a dead end with even more corpses.
                    
                    Thankfully it has nothing else.
                    
                    Soon enough, you two could both see the entrance. Both of you happily run over. Even if you two couldn't survive out there, it was better than staying inside.
                    
                    Besides, they have each other.
                    
                    That's all that matters right now.
