        <p id="dialogue">You are on the run from beasts, zombified wolves. Normal wolves were dangerous enough when times were peaceful, but now there is a whole pack of undead ones.<br><br>Your daughter is in your arms, stlll sleeping restlessly while your loyal dog ran with you.<br><br>You were lucky no one in the family were turned, but life is dangerous and it can end at any moment.<br><br>You have ran and ran until there was only a single place to run... a... castle? <br><br>The howls of wolves came ever so closer from behind, so you clenched your teeth and charged in.<br><br>It was time to gamble.</p>
