        <p id="dialogue">"Null, stay here and protect Noel."<br><br>"Woof!" Null gives you his bravest face and you smiled.<br><br>Then you took a deep breath and went back out to where the other corridor was.<br><br>Just in time, you saw the wolves peeking past the other corner and you yelled at them while you ran,<br><br>"You wolves don't scare me!"<br><br>A couple caught up, but you slashed at them with a knife.<br><br>Then Null was running by you!<br><br>"What?"<br><br>You look back to see that Null was also baiting a couple wolves, some may have went to where Noel was so Null had no choice but to fight and lead them away as well. <br><br>You ran into the right tunnel while Null ran into the left one.<br><br>The furious barkings slowly fade away as you were also caught up by the wolves.<br><br>"Howl!"<br><br>A bite. It was all it took.<br><br>All it needed was one bite for someone to turn into a zombie. And you were bitten.<br><br>Should you keep running or stand and fight?</p>
