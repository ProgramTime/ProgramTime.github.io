It was best to kill as many of these wolves as you can to give your child a hope.<br><br>Perhaps it was too hopeful of you to hope a single child can survive by herself, but there is always hope.<br><br>You brandish your knife and went head on.<br><br>"Howl!!!"<br><br>You fight and fight until you could not longer feel anything. As the last of the wolves were killed and you feel yourself slipping away, you tried to drag yourself away.<br><br>The farther you were from Noel, the better.<br><br>You dragged yourself into a dead end, using the last of your energy and consciousness, you wrote to her.</p>
