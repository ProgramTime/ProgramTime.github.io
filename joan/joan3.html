He suddenly takes out a knife and lashes it at you.<br><br>But your loyal dog was on him in an instant and breaks the man's neck.<br><br>Staring down at his corpse, you take the knife and drag the man into the corner. He had a bag on him, but you didn't have time to check it before the warning howls of the wolves came closer.<br><br>"Null, thank you." <br><br>"Woof!"<br><br>And you two continue running.<br><br>Noel thankfully remained asleep. She has seen enough for now.<br><br>A corridor opening to the left is appearing.<br><br>Take the left or keep going straight?</p>
